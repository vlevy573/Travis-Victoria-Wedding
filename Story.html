                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Our story starts out like a lot of couple's do these days â€¦ online! A couple of swipes right on an app and a funny quip about Game of Thrones later and they were scheduling their first date. And it really only took that one date to know they had something special. Charmaine was still shocked though when two weeks later Joel invited her to a Spring bok playoff game. Surely he had guy friends who would want to be there instead? But she wasn't going to turn down playoff tickets, so they bundled up for their first of many adventures. And it was clear to her at that point just how invested Joel was in their relationship.
                    <br>
                    We'd say the rest is history, but most of you know that just isn't true. Just a few months into their relationship, armed with keys she was almost certain were given to her too soon, Charmaine went to Joel's condo to find him gravely ill. Joel would spend the next three weeks in the hospital recovering from a serious blood infection and open heart surgery to repair a damaged heart valve. Charmaine visited almost everyday, and they watched many, many Marvel movies together while he recovered. It was a stressful and emotional time, but they knew after that they were absolutely meant to be in each other's lives. And thank goodness for Joel giving her those keys so soon!
                    <br>
                    Over the next two years they enjoyed many more, slightly less stressful, adventures together. Days on the beach with friends, and eventually on the mountains when Charmaine got Joel to start skiing again. They spent time away, both close by in Durban, Cape Town and as far as the Grand Canyon and national parks in the US. They eventually moved in together and most recently, bought a house! Joel even got Charmaine's cat Willow to warm up to him - no small feat.
                    <br>
                    Last January, while away with friends on a ski weekend, Joel got down on one knee and asked Charmaine to marry him. Even though she almost spoiled the surprise, she quickly said YES! It was the easiest question she's ever answered.
                    <br>
                    They can't wait for their next adventure with all of you later this year! They're looking forward to being able to share some time with you all together.</p>
